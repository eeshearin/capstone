# Coursera Data Science Capstone

This app was designed to meet the criteria of the Coursera Johns Hopkins Data Science Capstone project, based on Swiftkey's research. 

Slides explaining the app's design and function, its strengths, and its goals can be found at http://rpubs.com/eeshearin/capstone.

Thanks to Bram van Zanten, Github user bramvz, for the suggestion of the implementation of a Stupid Backoff model, much more effiecient than my attempt at a full-on Backoff model, and for his tips on cleaning up my app UI.
